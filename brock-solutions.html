                    <h4>Goal:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I would like to become better at communicating with others about systems and processes within the system. I find that when colleagues of mine are speaking in depth about how a system works I can become lost. As well when I try to explain myself to others I can confuse even myself in trying to explain how something I have developed works. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Each day at Brock we do a scrum where the team gets together and we share what we were working on the previous day, what has us stuck, and any other questions we have that the team may be able to answer. Scrum gives us all a good chance to catch up with each other, learn about other parts of the project and ask questions to clarify misunderstandings. I will take full advantage of these scrum sessions in order to improve my oral communication    
                    </p>
                    <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The best way to measure whether or not I have become a better oral communicator is within those scrums when I explain my process to others and realize that they are following along and understand what I mean, then I will feel like I have achieved this goal. Although it is always something that can be improved        
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                    <p>
                        One definitive way to know whether or not I have progressed on a goal during a work term is to hear my supervisor's thoughts on the goal. In this case, my talent manager told me that I have shown progress on this goal within my four months at Brock. He told me that I became much better at communicating through online services such as Jira and Perforce and I was skilled in communicating during our daily scrums and during conference calls over skype. I feel that I did improve over the course of the term and became a better communicator across all the platforms that we used at Brock.

                    <h4>Goal:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The system I am working with here at Brock is very large, sometimes it is extremely difficult to read the code and understand what is going on, this is a skill I would like to develop. It is important to be able to read old code, know how it works and what it is doing, to be able to modify that code. This code is also very sparsely commented, so understanding the naming techniques of various classes and methods will help with this goal.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The best way to get better at something is to practice. Reading and understanding old code is something we must do every time we are given a new task, so I believe there is plenty of time in this work term for me to practice and refine this skill.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                    <p>
                        This skill is one that will be difficult to measure, by the end of the term I should be familiar with the structure of the code and the conventions used, which will aid me in understanding the code. If I am still unable to read a function and not understand what it is used for then I will have not accomplished this goal.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of my work term, the stack at Brock was very overwhelming, but as I worked through various parts of the stack on different projects the structure and layout of it all began to make more sense to me. With that, I was much more easily able to navigate the source code and find what I was looking for in order to begin work. This skill is one that I will constantly be trying to improve upon, and I feel that these past four months were very beneficial in this aspect.

                    <h4>Goal:</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the goals I am most ambitious to meet, but also may take the longest time to accomplish, is being more independent. I would like to be able to sit down, start a project and complete that project without needing aid from other people. I find that I am unable to do highly complex things without the help of another person that I can explain my questions to and they can answer them. It is a problem of not really knowing what I'm trying to do (or what the industry calls that thing) to be able to look it up myself.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Expanding my knowledge of different processes, overtime will help me accomplish this goal. Reading more articles and books on computer programming will help. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I will have accomplished this goal when I feel confident to do a project without having to message a colleague and ask "how do I do this" but instead I can do a quick internet search myself or figure it out in the code on my own. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                    <p>
                        This was another goal that I was very proud to hear my supervisor say, that I had made progress on. I also feel very accomplished in this goal, as I was able to figure a lot of things out on my own with very little help. Completing complicated tasks by myself makes me feel great, especially when I am able to do it in a time frame that sometimes surprised my supervisors.

                    <h4>Goal:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, at Brock Solutions I code exclusively in Java, I hope that spending 4 months using this language I will increase my knowledge of the language itself and the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm as much as possible. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Using the language on a day-to-day basis will help build my understanding of it, asking questions when I'm unsure, and using my online resources as a tool for understanding concepts within the language helps.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I think one great measure of success for this goal would be to read over a few of the practice exams that I have leftover from my Java programming course, if I can score high on those, then clearly I was successful in picking up the language.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Did I master Java? Well no probably not, but for my level of experience, I definitely feel like I achieved my goal. I learned a lot of things about Java that make the language very powerful and make my time developing shorter. I feel as though if I went back and re-took that Java programming course I would fall asleep during lectures and whiz through the assignments.

                    <h4>Goal:</h4>
                    <p>
                        In my position at Brock we use Windows as the main OS, Perforce as our main Version Control and JIRA as our task planner. These are all software packages that  I have not used very much in the past, and I could learn a lot about at my time here.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The knowledge I need to be successful when programming on a windows machine lies within my colleagues. I have already been shown so many different little tricks to make life easier on a Windows machine. Perforce and JIRA are tools that are very new to me and again my colleagues are probably the best resource for help on these, but as always the internet will also be a good place to find help. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                    <p>
                        I would like to be able to confidently explain, perhaps in an interview, the steps to using any of the software we use at Brock and why or how they would be an advantage over others of the same function.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflection:</h4>

                        This goal was probably the easiest to accomplish, I mean really all I had to do was show up. Learning Perforce was an interesting curve in the beginning, but I got the hang of it quite quickly. Jira was very similar to Phabricator which I have used previously. As for coding on a Windows machine, I learned all the commands and tricks that helped with my specific job quickly. Although we did not use the command prompt very often, which is something I would like to expand my knowledge on in the future.

                <p>
                    Brock Solutions was a great place to work and gain experience relevant to my career goals. Being that I had previously worked in a startup company, there was quite a 'cultural shock' when I first started. The dynamics of the two workplaces are much different, and I feel grateful for being able to experience the structured, team-based, goal-driven environment at Brock Solutions. The incredible team atmosphere was enlightening, there was always a team member available to assist me in even the smallest of tasks. The goal-oriented atmosphere was also something I found valuable, having constant updates on timelines, release dates, due dates for proposals, etc. As a developer I sometimes worry about the speed at which I get things done, having frequent updates on the timeline for project completion takes a lot of that stress away. 
                    <br><br>
                    At Brock Solutions all of the developing is done on Windows machines, which was a great learning opportunity for me since I barely use windows at all anymore and have never coded on Windows before. I think that because I have a passion for cybersecurity that I should definitely have a strong understanding of how Windows machines work. I had only ever used Git as a version control system before coming to Brock, where instead of Git's Distributed Version Control style, they use a program called Perforce which is a Centralized Version Control. This was also an excellent chance for me to pick up new skills and become more familiar with different software.
