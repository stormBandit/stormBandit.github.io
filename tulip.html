                        <h4>Goal:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I would like to gain a much more in-depth understanding of how web sites work with a server 
                            and a database in order to create an efficient and effective environment. I want to expand my 
                            knowledge of the different languages used in web development such as Php, javascript, CSS, 
                            jquery and I would like a deeper understanding of MySQL.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I will accomplish this goal by asking many questions to my manager and team for clarification 
                            of different processes and to teach me new skills each day. I would also like to check in with 
                            my manager when I accomplish tasks to ensure that I am doing them in the most effective/efficient 
                            way possible.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I will measure this goal by building a simplistic website of my own and seeing how easily I am 
                            able to do so, acquiring more knowledge and practice with the parts I struggle with.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I believe I have come a long way with my own knowledge of many of the systems I mentioned in my 
                            goal. I have a much better understanding of how websites work and have expanded my knowledge of 
                            PHP, MySql, javascript, and CSS as I had hoped. I have been building a website throughout this 
                            term to use as both a training tool for myself and a work term report to be graded for co-op. 
                            Being successful in this build shows that I have accomplished my goal.

                        <h4>Goal:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I would like to become better at communicating with others about systems and processes within a 
                            system. I find that when colleagues of mine are speaking in depth about how a system works I can 
                            become lost. As well when I try to explain myself to others I can confuse even myself in trying 
                            to explain how something I have developed works.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Each day at Tulip we do a scrum where the team gets together and we share what we were working on 
                            the previous day as well as what we will be working on today. Scrum gives us ll a good chance to catch up 
                            with each other, learn about other parts of the project and ask questions to clarify misunderstandings. 
                            I will take full advantage of these scrum sessions in order to improve my oral communication.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The best way to measure whether or not I have become a better oral communicator is within those scrum sessions 
                            when I explain my process to others and realize that they are following along and understand what I mean, then  
                            I will feel like I have achieved this goal. Although it is always something that can be improved.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I believe that I have become a much more effective communicator and that my questions have 
                            become much more efficient. I am able to more efficiently find the answers I need in order to solve my problem, 
                            and I am much better at targeting my questions at the right person. I also feel that because of this I am more often 
                            able to find the answers to my own questions through searching more effectively with online resources.

                        <h4>Goal:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The system I am working with here at Tulip is very large, sometimes it is extremely difficult to 
                            read the code and understand what is going on, this is a skill I would like to develop. It is 
                            important to be able to read old code, know how it works and to then be able to modify that code.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The best way to get better at something is to practice. Reading and understanding old code is 
                            something we must do every time we are given a new task, so I believe there is plenty of time in 
                            this work term for me to practice and refine this skill.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This skill is one that will be difficult to measure, by the end of the term I should be familiar 
                            with the structure of the code and the conventions used, which will aid me in understanding the 
                            code. If I am still unable to read a function and understand what it is used for then I will 
                            have not accomplished this goal.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I believe being able to read and comprehend old code or code written by someone else is a skill 
                            that can be constantly developed and it is not something that can be taught. One great benefit 
                            to me with this co-op position was that a lot of the code I worked with was written by a multitude 
                            of authors, this opened my eyes to how difficult reading old code can be. This also gave me 
                            an excellent opportunity to work on this goal. I feel that my skill in this area did improve 
                            but can always be improved more and this will enable me to fix bugs and implement new features more efficiently.

                        <h4>Goal:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I am the type of student that is better at remembering concepts once I 
                            truly understand why something is the way it is. Knowing this about myself 
                            it is my goal to learn why we do certain things at Tulip when it comes to the 
                            development cycle, the tech stack used and the way features are implemented. 
                            This will help me build a better understanding of software development as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The best plan of action to accomplish this goal is to ask my colleagues to explain. 
                            I would also like to start reading a few more of those articles that I get emailed 
                            to me every month that I normally just skim through and toss in my trash.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is a hard goal to measure, in terms of this goal I really think that it will 
                            be more of a self-evaluated kind of goal. I think if I ask enough questions to expand 
                            my global understanding of how certain processes work then I will have achieved this goal.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is probably the hardest goal I made for myself for this term, and if I'm being honest, 
                            the goal that I failed at the most. This is a very hard goal to accomplish in a short amount 
                            of time. I feel like the best thing I did to work towards this goal was having conversations 
                            with my colleagues at Tulip. The team was always willing to share their knowledge and explain 
                            concepts that I did not understand. I liked to discuss different concepts with colleagues and 
                            learn from their experiences with different technologies they've used, and try to gain insight 
                            into the most effective ways to accomplish tasks.

                        <h4>Goal:</h4>
                        <p>
                            One of the goals I am most ambitious to meet, but also may take the longest 
                            time to accomplish, is being more independent. I would like to be able to 
                            sit down, start a project and complete that project without needing aid from 
                            other people. I find that I am unable to do highly complex things without 
                            the help of another person that I can explain my questions to and they can 
                            answer. I find that I learn much better when I am shown something and can have 
                            someone to ask my questions in order to iterate over the process, to really 
                            make sense of it. It is a problem of not really knowing what I'm trying to do 
                            (or what the industry calls that thing) to be able to look it up myself.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Action Plan:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Expanding my knowledge of different processes, overtime will help me accomplish this goal. 
                            Reading more articles and books on computer programming will also help. I have signed up 
                            for an email list of articles about new technologies and tutorials of various web development 
                            skills which I think will also benefit me in acieving this goal.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Measure of Success:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I will have accomplished this goal when I feel confident to do a project without having to 
                            message a colleague and ask "how do I do this" but instead I can do a quick internet search 
                            myself or figure it out on my own.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
                        <p>
                            If I am being honest, this is the goal that I feel I worked the least at during this term, 
                            I did manage to read a few more articles and view a few more videos that were informative. 
                            However, I still found myself "saving them for later" often times and never actually going 
                            back to read them. This is a tough goal, and I understand that it will come in time and hopefully 
                            I will be able to find the time to expand this knowledge. Extending on this goal, and 
                            adding in an action plan of finding time at least 2-3 times per week to sit down and start 
                            going through some of the content I found interesting and "saved for later".

                    <p>
                        Tulip Retail was an incredible place to work, I was fortunate to experience the rich culture of a tech startup in the heart of Toronto. Being my first co-op job I did not know what to expect at any workplace. The culture of a tech startup such as Tulip is very different from what I had expected. I believe everyone should take the opportunity to experience this easy-going and open culture. The biggest surprise that I encountered was the openness among the company, we would have weekly updates about what was going on in the company. These updates would include an update about plans for the future of the company and overall management decisions. In any other company I have worked at in the past, these are not the sorts of topics that are discussed with all staff and are more kept on a need to know basis. This was an incredible learning experience for me. 
                        <br><br>
                        The benefits of working in a startup don't just end with the culture, there was an immense amount of support and encouragement given by all members of the team. The support I was shown from my co-workers was something I could never have imagined. I worked on a team of three, where two of us were co-op students. Sometimes my manager would be too busy, managing, but I would still be able to find the assistance I needed to complete a task through other channels in the company. Being my first co-op position this was a huge advantage to me, enabling me to learn a vast amount of skills and expand my knowledge of many different topics. People at Tulip were very friendly and often times I found myself learning more from them about different software applications than I learn from my professors in school. 
                        <br><br>
                        I met some amazing and very talented people working at Tulip and would recommend working here to anyone looking for a fun, challenging and rewarding workplace :D
